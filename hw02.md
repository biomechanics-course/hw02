Homework 2

1.  A two-link system has a forward kinematics Jacobian yielding
    ${}_{e} \triangleq \left\lbrack {\dot{x}}_{P},{\dot{y}}_{P},{\dot{\theta}}_{2} \right\rbrack^{T}$,
    the translational velocity of the endpoint and angular velocity of
    that link (arranged in a single column). The Jacobian is multiplied
    by $\left\lbrack {\dot{q}}_{1},{\dot{q}}_{2} \right\rbrack^{T}$.

$$J = \begin{bmatrix}
L\cos q_{1} + \frac{L}{2}\cos{(q_{1} - q_{2})} & - L\cos{(q_{1} - q_{2})} \\
 - L\sin q_{1} + \ldots & L\sin{(q_{1} - q_{2})} \\
 - 1 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

1.  ![](media/image1.emf){width="2.111111111111111in"
    height="1.6868055555555554in"}Find the constraint Jacobian $C$ for
    the two segments shown, which are to be connected to form a planar
    biped model. The pose $\mathbf{X}$ is defined as
    $\left\lbrack x_{c1},y_{c1},\theta_{1},x_{c2},y_{c2},\theta_{2} \right\rbrack^{T}\text{.\ }$Point
    $O$ is to be attached to the ground origin, and the two pelvis
    points to each other, both with hinge joints. The constraint
    function should be the Jacobian of the position of point $O$
    relative to origin, and of the position error
    $\left( x_{P^{'}} - x_{P},\ y_{P^{'}} - y_{P} \right)$, such that
    $C\dot{\mathbf{X}} = \epsilon$, with $\epsilon$ kept near zero.

a.  Find the missing elements:

$$C = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & l_{c1}\cos\theta_{1} & & & \\
 & & & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 & & & & & \\
0 & - 1 & & 0 & 1 & - l_{c2}\sin\theta_{2} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

a.  For the same system, an event function would be needed to halt the
    simulation when the foot $F$ strikes ground. What would be an
    appropriate event function (using $\mathbf{X}$)? And what would be
    an appropriate state vector for the ordinary differential equation?

$$z = \left\lbrack x_{c1},y_{c1},\theta_{1},x_{c2},y_{c2},\theta_{2},{\dot{x}}_{c1},{\dot{y}}_{c1},{\dot{\theta}}_{1},{\dot{x}}_{c2},{\dot{y}}_{c2},{\dot{\theta}}_{2} \right\rbrack^{T}$$

a.  The pose Jacobian (forward kinematics) is

$$J = \begin{bmatrix}
 - l_{c1}\cos q_{1} & 0 \\
 - l_{c1}\sin q_{1} & 0 \\
1 & 0 \\
 - l_{1}\cos q_{1} & l_{c2}\cos q_{2} \\
 - l_{1}\sin q_{1} & l_{c2}\sin q_{2} \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

Test whether $CJ = 0$, and in your own words, explain why it should be.

a.  Suppose the segment masses are $m_{1}$, $m_{2}$. How would you find
    the Jacobian for the whole system center of mass? (Keep this simple,
    preferably a single matrix multiplication.
    $\left\lbrack {\dot{x}}_{\text{com}},{\dot{y}}_{\text{com}} \right\rbrack^{T} = J_{\text{com}}\dot{q})$

1.  A computational way to minimize a function is to satisfy the
    necessary condition for a minimum. The necessary condition is that
    the partial derivatives of the function with respect to its (vector)
    input $x$ must all be zero. You have already written fjacobian,
    which calculates the partial derivative numerically, and this must
    be paired with some code to determine the x satisfying the necessary
    condition. See findmin\_startercode and testfindmin for a partial
    example.

<!-- -->

a.  Write your own findmin function, using two functions you have
    already written.

b.  Notice that the test function uses a known solution
    $x^{*} = - Q^{- 1}b$ to minimize $\frac{1}{2}x^{T}Qx + b^{T}x$.
    Briefly explain why this is the case.

c.  Even if the necessary conditions are satisfied, the solution $x^{*}$
    might not actually minimize the test function. Briefly explain what
    why. (It may help to browse a tutorial on numerical optimization.)

![](media/image2.png){width="3.1625in" height="2.53125in"}4. The
normalized force-velocity curve is described by the formula
${\tilde{F}}_{\text{CE}} = (1 - {\tilde{v}}_{\text{CE}})/(1 + \frac{{\tilde{v}}_{\text{CE}}}{a_{f}})$,
which has a single parameter *a~f~* that describes the shape of the
curve. Two other parameters are needed to specify the curve in physical
units: the maximum shortening velocity and the peak isometric force. By
trial and error, try to roughly estimate parameter values for each of
the two curves shown here (except for peak force), and use them to plot
the modeled force-velocity curves (during shortening only). Data from
Ruiter et al. (2000) J. Physiol. 526.3: 671-681.

5.  ![](media/image4.emf){width="2.2375in"
    height="1.4291666666666667in"}Devise a full step simulation of the
    simple rimless wheel shown at right. The system consists of massless
    legs at a fixed angle 2*Î±* apart, with a point mass located at the
    hip and a radius of gyration of *r*~gyr~. It has only one degree of
    freedom and is simpler than systems you have already simulated. The
    specifications are as follows: The function should be called
    **rimlesswheelstep.m**, with similar output to the previous
    **rimlesswheelstance**, except that the first output should be the
    initial state of the next step. In the step-to-step transition, the
    next step begins with the stance leg resets to $\alpha$, and its
    angular velocity to
    ${\dot{\theta}}^{+} = {\dot{\theta}}^{-}\cos{2\alpha}$ where plus
    and minus refer to states just before and after ground contact
    (${\dot{\theta}}^{-}$ is the final velocity of the step that just
    ended).

    a.  Use testrimlesswheel to test your simulation. Note that there
        > are multiple plots produced by the Matlab cells.

    b.  Notice that the states vary over time. Briefly explain in your
        > own words the trajectories of $\theta$ and $\dot{\theta}$, for
        > example, why $\dot{\theta}$ has an inverted U shape with each
        > step.

    c.  Briefly explain the energy trajectory, for example why the
        > energy decreases with each step, and why the energy within
        > each step is very nearly, but not exactly, constant.

    d.  Briefly explain why the initial $\dot{\theta}$ for each
        > consecutive step is changing, and asymptoting toward a steady
        > value over many steps.

    e.  Suppose you wish to find an initial angular velocity
        > [[]{#OLE_LINK19 .anchor}]{#OLE_LINK18
        > .anchor}$\dot{\theta}(0)$ such that the system produces a
        > periodic motion, so that multiple steps can be taken one after
        > the other, all repeating the same motion. How can this be

        > appropriate $\dot{\theta}\left( 0 \right)$.

Optional: It will be helpful to be able to derive equations of motion
analytically. If you have access to Mathematica, try out this package to
automatically generate equations.
